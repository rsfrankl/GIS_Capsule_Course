## About QGIS@GSSI

These materials support the summer course in spatial data, visualization, and GIS in the [Regional Science and Economic Geography](https://www.gssi.it/education/regional-science-economic-geography) program at the [Gran Sasso Science Institute](https://www.gssi.it) (GSSI) in L'Aquila, Italy.

## About your course lead: Rachel Franklin

I'm a quantitative human geographer in the [Centre for Urban and Regional Development Studies](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/curds/) (CURDS) at Newcastle University. I'm also the group lead for liveability in the [Science of Cities and Regions Programme](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/urban-analytics) at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk), the UK's national institute for data science and AI.

I've taught spatial analysis GIS to a range of audiences for almost 15 years, including several times at the GSSI, and have taught quantitative and demographic methods for over 20 years.

## About these teaching materials

These materials are aimed at students who are experts in something *other* than geography and spatial analysis. The primary goal is twofold: to illustrate the potential and utlity of spatial thinking and methods and to provide a user-friendly introduction to applying spatial thinking and methods.

The code and license for all these materials can be found on GitHub [{{< fa brands github >}}](https://github.com/rsfrankl/GIS_capsule_course).
