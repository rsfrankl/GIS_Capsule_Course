# Goals for today's session

- Comfort with basic cartographic principles
- Ability to match symbology to data type
- Introduction to map elements

# Visualizing spatial data

## Representing different kinds of information

The way in which we display data on the map needs to match not only the type of data but also the type of feature

- **Nominal** -- labels
- **Categorical** -- different symbol or color for each category
- **Ordinal** -- we want to use color or symbol size to convey the increase in value that goes with each category
  - Graduated or proportional symbol maps.  
- **Numerical** – for points and lines, we use lines thickness or symbol size to express variations in value
  - For polygons we use graduated color or choropleth maps
  - Single color that changes in intensity to convey changes in value
  - Sometimes two colors are used

## Classification Schemes

Mapping continuous data means we need a meaningful way to create categories -- this is called classification

- Similar to choices that are made in generating a histogram

- How we allocate values to categories will affect our final map
  - This means number of categories
  - But also the classification scheme itself
- Ideally you are able to justify your choices (good general advice!)
  - What is the takeaway message you want to convey?
  - Who is your audience?

## Types of classification

- **Natural breaks (Jenks)** -- looks at the distribution of values and sets the break points at “natural breaks” in the data
- **Equal interval** -- Creates a set number of classes of equal size
- **Fixed interval** -- Same as equal interval, except you decide the size of the interval and the number of classes depends on that decision (e.g., by 1,000s)
- **Quantile (equal count)** -- puts the same number of features into each class
- **Standard deviation** -- creates categories based on the number of standard deviations away from the mean
- **Pretty breaks** -- Breaks categories at round numbers
- **Manual** -- you choose the break points yourself

# Map design

## What do we need to think about?

- **Map elements** – the pieces of a map that make it a finished (and polished product)
  - Individual elements should contribute to conveying information, not detract from it
  - Limit clumping together of elements
  - Limit use of multiple fonts and colors
- **Map symbology** – the way in which the information the map conveys is portrayed
  - Colors – hue, intensity, and saturation
  - Symbols – size and type
- By necessity, maps are selective of the information they show and information is generalized

## Choosing symbols and colors

- Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but there are some general guidelines!
- Water and land should not be given unusual colors---e.g., water is blue not red
- Increased thickness of lines or larger symbols should match increased value
- Darker or more intense colors usually go with higher values
- If you use a color ramp with two colors, your data should also reflect two extremes in value---for example, in and out migration or voting patterns
- Avoid mixing and matching lots of different patterns on the same map---the eye can’t handle it

# Types of maps

## So many ways to visualize information on a map!

- **Thematic Maps** -- organize and display spatial variation of a single variable
- **Choropleth maps** -- changes in a variable are classified and mapped by some administrative category (e.g. countries or states)
- **Dasymetric maps** -- Uses additional information to allocate value within polygons
- **Isoline** or **contour maps** -- lines delineate areas of similar value.  E.g., air pressure or elevation
- **Reference maps** -- may display lots of different types of information
  - Topological maps or atlases
- **Dot** maps, **picture symbol** maps, **graduated symbol** maps
- **Network** and flow maps -- show direction and magnitude of flows
- **Cartograms**---a unit’s display area is determined not by its actual area but by an attribute value

# Maps are more than pretty objects!

## Questions we can ask about maps and spatial data

- What are the high and low values and where are they? 
- Does there appear to be a relationship between location and value?
- Do similar values appear to be located close together, or clustered?  Is another spatial pattern discernible?
- Are there characteristics of areas that appear to correspond with particular sets of values?  e.g., coastal or inner city.
- Would the pattern change if we change the scale of analysis?  For example, what happens to the spatial pattern if we go from counties to states?
