# Introductions

-   Who am I?
-   Who are you?

# Agenda for today

-   Why GIS for economic geography and regional science?
    -   Research example: depopulation
-   The basics of GIS
    -   Why do we need a GIS?
    -   What is a GIS?
    -   Visualizing data in a GIS
    -   Finding spatial data
-   A few more examples

# An example: US depopulation

## Some takeaways

-   Understanding local population change requires a contextual approach, such as the historical patterns of change and the experiences of surrounding regions
-   Our typology approach, which groups the patterns of population changes for both individual areas and their neighboring regions over a span of 70 years, provides a detailed understanding of how depopulation has spatially unfolded in the United States
-   GIS underpins this analysis, even if methods are more geographic data science

# Thinking spatially

## Common kinds of spatial questions

-   *How does a variable or phenomenon vary over space (e.g. income)?* (Can be answered with a map)
-   *How does distance to university influence innovation or entrepreneurship?* (Can be answered using traditional statistical software, with spatial variables created using GIS)
-   *What is the spatial distribution of crime in a given city?* (Can be answered with maps and descriptive spatial statistics)
-   *How are business success and neighborhood characteristics related?* (Can be answered with spatial statistics and models)

## Early spatial analysis example: John Snow’s 1854 Cholera Map

## What can we do with a GIS?

-   **Data visualization** -- for example, exploratory analysis or cartography
-   **Explore geographic coincidence** -- for example, how many new firms in a region
-   **Calculate geometries** -- for example, length of road in an area, or the center of a polygon
-   **Identification of spatial patterns** -- for example, clusters or hot spots
-   **Finding spatial relationships** -- for example, measuring exposure, accessibility, or market areas
-   **Calculating spatial variables** -- for example, distance or proximity
-   **Estimating values or density** -- for example, interpolation

## There are so many ways to think about space

# How a Geographic Information System (GIS) works

## Organizing spatial data in a GIS

![Source: krygier.owu.edu](images_lectures/GIS_layers){fig-align="center"}

## Organizing spatial data in a GIS

-   A GIS doesn’t save information as maps
    -   Rather, we tell the GIS how to locate objects in relation to other objects and in space
-   Things to be aware of:
    -   Your spatial data model
    -   The relationships your objects have with each other in the real world
    -   e.g., street intersections or shared regional borders
    -   Referred to as, “topology”

## Spatial data models

-   Most common are **vector** and **raster** ![](images_lectures/data_models){fig-align="center"}

## Spatial data models

-   Most common are **vector** and **raster** ![](images_lectures/data_models_example){fig-align="center"}

## Vector model

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
![](images_lectures/vector_example)
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
-   Features are stored as discrete **points**, **lines** or **polygons**
    -   All are combinations of nodes and/or vertices
-   Locations are recorded as X,Y coordinates
:::
:::

## Something special about the vector model: The attribute table

-   Each feature – point, line, or polygon – is dynamically linked to the “**attribute table**” or set of variables
    -   For example, you could have a dataset of cities, represented as points, and the attribute table might contain characteristics of the city – population, median household income, etc. ![](images_lectures/attribute_table){width="60%" fig-align="center"}

## Why we like the vector model (and we really do)

-   Features can be located precisely
-   We can store lots of information (variables or attributes) about each feature
-   Useful for many types of map-making
-   Perfect for types of analysis, such as areas, lengths, or connections
-   Used **a lot** in the social sciences

## Raster model

::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
-   Sub-divides a study area into square pixels – rows and columns
-   Only need the location of the upper left-hand corner and all other locations are implicit, assuming you know your pixel size
-   Only one value is recorded for each pixel
    -   For example, temperature, precipitation, or land use type
:::

::: {.column width="65%"}
![](images_lectures/raster_model)
:::
:::

## Raster model

-   So long as the x, y location is georeferenced (placed on the surface of the earth), we can locate each other pixel, too

![](images_lectures/raster_georef){fig-align="center"}

## Why we like the raster model

-   Best for **continuous data**
-   Analysis can sometimes be faster
-   And some types of analysis require raster data
-   “Yes, raster is faster, but raster is vaster, and vector just seems more correcter.” – Dana Tomlin
-   Remember: pixel size (or **resolution**) matters!
