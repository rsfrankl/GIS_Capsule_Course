title: "GIS Capsule Course"

## Introduction

Almost every year since 2017 I've visited the GSSI in L'Aquila, Italy, to meet students and offer an introduction to GIS. This year is the year I finally move it all online.

## Welcome and Benvenuti

This short course introduces students to the fundamentals of GIS: locating, importing, and visualizing spatial data, as well as common spatial analysis methods and approaches. Each day’s activity is organized around short lectures, complemented by hands-on tutorials and independent work that provide structured practice working with data, software, and common spatial methods.

## Progettino

Students will select a mini-project, or *progettino* that allows them to apply the skills they’ve learned, with brief presentations on the final afternoon.
