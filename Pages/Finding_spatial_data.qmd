Spatial data can be found in lots of places! Essentially, as long as your data tells you *where* something is---place, address, lat/long--the GIS is going to have tools to import, visualise, and work with that data.

## City Data Portals
Many cities maintain open data portals that typically include a variety of spatial data, for example:

- [Milano](https://dati.comune.milano.it)
- [Paris](https://opendata.paris.fr/pages/home/)
- [London](https://data.london.gov.uk/topic)
- [San Francisco](https://datasf.org/opendata/)

## Country-level Data
Many countries serve up data for administrative areas, often as separate tabular and spatial data.

Tip: tabular joins are often the easiest way to make these data work in a GIS environment!

- European Union
  - [Eurostat Database](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database)
  - [GIS Boundary Files](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/statistical-units/territorial-units-statistics)
  - [Gridded Data](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/population-distribution)
- [United Kingdom](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk)
- [United States--NHGIS](https://www.nhgis.org)
- [New Zealand](https://data.linz.govt.nz/data/)

## Land Cover Data
Often involves big rasters!

- [Europe--Copernicus](https://land.copernicus.eu/en/products/corine-land-cover)
- [US National Land Cover Database (NLCD)](https://www.mrlc.gov/data)

## Other Cool Options
*Any spreadsheet* containing latitude and longitude coordinates can be easily imported into a GIS, which opens up a world of possibility! For example:
