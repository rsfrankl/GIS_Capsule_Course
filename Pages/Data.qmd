For your *progettino*, you'll locate and use your own data. See [Finding spatial data](Finding_spatial_data.qmd) for some ideas.

## Practical Data
For practicals, we'll use the data below. To work with these datasets in QGIS, you'll need to download the zipped folder and then expand and save in your preferred location (I suggest a new folder on your Desktop or in your Documents). **Pay attention to where you save your data and your QGIS projects! And ideally you keep it all together in one folder!**

Once unzipped, most data are in geopackage (gpkg) format---a container holding several spatial layers. 

- [Rome Data](Rome_Data.zip)
- [European Union (EU) Example](EU_Mapping_Example.zip)
- [Spatial Analysis Data](Spatial_Analysis.zip)

### Where do these datasets come from?

  - Luoghi della Cultura (Cultural Locations)
  - Zone Urbanistiche (Urban Zones)
  - Waterways (Idrografia)

**Note:** Many of these datasets have been cleaned and curated to make them easier to work with for practicals!
