    "text": "Adding Data and Getting Started (!!)\n\nExpand the Tutorial_Data folder. You should see an icon in the shape of a cylinder. This denotes a GeoPackage, which is a database format that allows multiple layers and related data to be stored in one file.\nNow expand the GeoPackage. You should see six layers, all for Rome, Italy:\n\n\nFrom the Rome Geoportal:\n\nPopolazione Residente Istat 2011 (Population Resident ISTAT 2023)\nLuoghi della Cultura (Cultural Locations)\nZone Urbanistiche (Urban Zones)\nWaterways (Idrografia)\n\nFrom Inside Airbnb:\n\nAirBnb listings from March 2023\nRome Neighbourhoods\n\n\n\nAdding data to your project: Grab and pull the Neighbourhoods_Rome layer down to the bottom left “Layers” window (see below). If this doesn’t work, see Step 9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble click on the “Neighbourhoods_Rome” layer and a new window will open. This takes you to the Layer Properties, which is where a lot of the work happens in QGIS. Click on the “Source” option and scroll down.\n Note: here is where you can see what projection (that is: coordinate reference system, or CRS) the layer is in, what its file path is, and what variables are included in the attribute table. When you’re done, close the Properties window.\n Another tip: Layer Properties can also be accessed by right-clicking on the layer and choosing Properties. When in doubt, try right-clicking!\nNow right click on the “Neighbourhoods_Rome” layer and select Open Attribute Table. This opens the data associated with the layer in a new window. You’ll see that this layer has 16 polygons and just one variable: the name of the neighborhood. When you’ve seen enough, close the attribute table.\nAnother way to add layers is from the Data Source Manager, which can be accessed from the menu icon  or via the Layer pulldown menu (Layer&gt;Data Source Manager).\nOpen the Data Source Manager. To add layers from a GeoPackage, we first need to connect to it. In the Data Source Manager Window, select “GeoPackage” from the list on the left.\nNow, in the central pane of the window, select “New” under “Connections”, navigate to the Rome_Data GeoPackage and select it, then click “Connect”. You should see all the GeoPackage Layers appear in the window below. Add the “AirBnb”, “Population_resident_ISTAT2011”, and “Waterways” layers by selecting and clicking “Add”. Close the Data Source Manager window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SAVE your project!\n\nYou should have four layers in your project now, but they are all piled on top of each other. Grab a layer and pull it above or below its neighbours. Try this a few times. What happens when you reorder the layers?\n Tip: If you add layers and decide you don’t want them, right click and select “Remove Layer”.\nNow right click on each layer and have a look at the attribute tables. What sorts of variables does each contain?\n\n Remember, QGIS projects do not save any data. They are simply instructions that tell QGIS what data to display and how to display it. If you move your project around without the accompanying layers, the project will be empty.\n\nNow spend some time practicing using the tools on the navigation tool bar. Make sure you understand what each tool does.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurn off all layers except Neighbourhoods and Population by unticking the box next to them. This keeps the layers in the project, but toggles their visibility. Pull the Population layer to the top. This obscures the Neighbourhoods layer, so let’s adjust the symbology so that we can see which ISTAT Population “census sections” fall into each Neighbourhood.\nOpen the Properties window for Population and choose the Symbology option. You have two choices: you can make the Population layer more transparent so that the Neighbourhoods layer shows through or you can adjust the Population polygon symbology so that the polygon has a border outline, but no fill.\nTo change layer transparency, adjust the Opacity level until you are satisfied (click “Apply” at the bottom of the window and observe the change on your screen).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo change polygon symbology, select the “Simple Fill” square near the top of the window. This will open a new set of symbology options. Fill controls what is inside the polygon, whilst Stroke controls the color, width, and style of the polygon border. Click on the little arrow to the right of the “Fill color” color, and choose “Transparent Fill”. Click Apply. It may take a few iterations to get a stroke color and width that you can see easily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the Layer Properties window for Neighbourhoods and choose the “Labels” option. At the top of this window, where it says “No Labels”, there is a pulldown menu. Choose “Single Labels” and Apply and leave the defaults for now. Close the Layer Properties.\nNow open the attribute table for the Population layer. The NUMERO_RES variable provides the 2011 resident population count for each census section.\nClick on the variable name at the top of the table to sort the values.\n\n\nWhich census areas have the largest population? The lowest?\nSelecting the numbers at the side of the attribute table will select census sections on the map. Now look at your map—one enormous strength of a GIS is its ability to perform database operations and then show you on the map where these entities are located. Is there any pattern to census sections with the highest populations? With zero population? When you’re done looking, be sure to clear your selection: .\n\n\nThere’s quite some variety of areas—–some have large populations and some much smaller. However, some districts are also much bigger polygons than others.\nTo ease comparison across census polygons, let’s create a new variable for population density. Population density is straightforward to calculate, as a measure of people/square unit of distance (e.g., kilometer, mile, or hectare).\n\n\nCreating a new variable: Make sure the Population layer is selected in your layers and then click on the Field Calculator icon .\n Good to know: the Field Calculator can also be accessed from the layer attribute table.\n There are three important components to creating a new variable: Field name, field type, and the expression (see below).\nIn this case, for field type, choosing integer in this case will only return whole numbers for density. Because we want to include fractional numbers, choose “Decimal number” for field type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick ok. To check your results, either look at the attribute table (the last column) or go directly to layer Symbology.\n\n Important: Adding a new variable makes permanent changes to the layer. After adding a new variable in this way, QGIS will require you to click the edit icon  and save your edits—be sure to check you’re happy before saying yes!\n\nWe’ll talk more about map-making, but for now, let’s gain some familiarity with basic symbology. Let’s visualize the variation in Population. To do this, open the Symbology window of the Layer Properties for the Population layer. At the top of the window where it says “Single Symbol” choose “Graduated”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will prompt you to choose a “Value”, which is the variable you want to visualise. Choose the “NUMERO_RES” variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will also need to choose which colors you want to use. Click on the arrow by “Color Ramp” and take your pick.\nNow click “Classify” and “Apply” and “OK”. Take a look at the result—can you still see Neighbourhood boundaries? How do you like the combination of colors? Feel free to make changes.\n\n Save your project!\n\nIn the main QGIS window, turn off Population and turn on your Waterways and AirBnb layers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the AirBnb attribute table. Selecting a subset of features: the AirBnb contains a variety of kinds of places to rent. Let’s isolate those where it’s the entire home/apartment.\nTo select a sub-category of AirBnb listings, you have two choices, to manually select, by sorting your attribute table as we did above, or “select features by expression” . The latter is much more reliable!\nTo select features by expression, you first need to know which variable has the information you want, and which values you’re looking for. Let’s select all AirBnbs in Rome that offer the entire home/apartment. Open the “select features by expression” window and then click on “Fields and Values”.\nWe will build an expression to select all features where the “room_type” is “Entire home/apt”. Double click on the “room_type” variable, then add an =, and then, on the right side of the window, select “All Unique”.\nThis will return a list of all the possible choices for this variable. Select “Entire home/apt” and then double click. You can also search for “Entire home/apt” in the search pane.\nWhen you’re finished, click “Select Features” at the bottom of the window and close. The top of your attribute table should say you have 17092 features selected (out of 24924), and when you close the attribute table, you should see a lot of points highlighted on the map view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a new “AirBnb_entire_home” layer: right click on the AirBnb layer and choose Export&gt;Save selected features. For Format, choose GeoPackage. For File name, navigate to the Rome_Data GeoPackage. Then give your new layer a name—AirBnb_entire_home is a good choice. Click OK. Your new AirBnb layer will be added in Layers, and also saved as a permanent layer in the GeoPackage, for re-use elsewhere.\nClear your AirBnb selection and turn that layer off.\nCreating and exporting a map layout. To create a map output that can be saved and used outside the GIS, we need to create a new Print Layout. Click the New Print Layout icon  or choose Project&gt;New Print Layout from the pulldown menu.\nYou’ll be prompted to give your layout a name. Choose something descriptive and click OK. A new window will open with a blank page and a new set of layout tools. Click the Add Map icon  and then use your mouse to draw a box that covers the entire page. Your layout should automatically populate with your AirBnb + Wards + Waterways layers from the main QGIS view.\nTake some time to explore the various tools in the layout view. You have the option to add text (e.g., a title), et cetera, if you like.  Remember to save your layout occasionally!\nExport your AirBnb map: There are several options for file formats for map exports, including image, SVG, or PDF . Click on the “Export as image” option and choose .png for a file format. When prompted, make sure your export resolution is at least 300 dpi and save your map. Save and close this layout (you’ll always be able to go back to it later).\n\nWell done! Take your map home and show it off to your friends!",

    "section": "AirBnb Counts and Prices by Area",
    "text": "AirBnb Counts and Prices by Area\n\nLet’s start by exploring alternative ways of visualizing the AirBnb points. The first option is to count the number of AirBnBs falling within each Urban Zone of Rome.\n\n\nUnder the Vector&gt;Analysis Tools pulldown menu, select “Count Points in Polygon”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will open an interface that asks you to specify the polygons that will receive the points, and the layer that contains the points—we want to use the Urban Zones layer and the AirBnb Layer (see screenshot, below).\n Important: many spatial analysis tools create a new layer, so you want to be sure to pay attention to where you are saving your output and what you are naming it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour new layer should be automatically added to your project.\n By the way: have you saved your project?!). Go to Symbology and try visualising the counts of AirBnbs by Urban Zone.\n\n\nWhat if we want to know the average price of AirBnbs per night, by Urban Zone?\nIt makes sense that Zones closer to the Centro Storico might be more expensive. To do this, we use a different, but similar, spatial join tool: “Join Attributes by Location (summary)”\n\n\nTo access this tool, we will need to open our QGIS “Toolbox”, which is opened by clicking the toolbox icon \nWhen you open the Toolbox, you are presented with many expandable menus. The tool we want, “Join Attributes by Location (summary)” is located in the “Vector general” menu.\n Note: If you know which tool you are looking for, it’s easiest to simply use the search menu!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the “Join Attributes by Location (summary)” tool.\nIn this interface, we will need to specify how the two layers should be combined—in this case, the Urban Zones contain the points. Tick that option.\nWe also need to choose which fields to summarise and which summary statistics to calculate. Click on  for Fields and Summaries and choose Count and Mean:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose a location and name to save your new layer. Your interface should look like below. Click Run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualise your average price results by Urban Zone. Do they make sense?\nNext let’s see which Metro stations have the most AirBnbs nearby, and the highest average prices. To do this, we use a new tool—Buffers—as the easiest way to find out quickly which Metro stations have the most AirBnbs.\n If we only wanted a variable that calculates the distance from each AirBnb to the closest Metro, we could use the “distance to Nearest Hub (Points)” tool.\n\n\nThe “Buffer” tool is located under the Vector pulldown menu and Geoprocessing Tools (see below). You can also find it by searching the Toolbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor buffers, we will need to establish what we think is “nearby” a Metro station. Let’s choose 500 meters.\n Important: Buffers are always calculated in the units of the projection! If unsure what those are, check properties.\nAs with spatial joins, you will also need to choose where to save your new buffer layer and a name!\n Hint: Make a habit of including your buffer size in your layer name!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick run.\n\n\nHave a look at your buffers: zoom in, look at the attribute table. Pause and make sure you understand what you’re looking at.\nNow use a spatial join to count AirBnbs that fall within the ambit of each Metro station’s buffer.\nYou can also calculate the average price of AirBnbs within each buffer.\nAre there areas that are clearly more expensive?",

They will be in the “Vector geometry” area.\nOpen the interface and choose Metro stations as your input layer.\n Important: many tools only operate on the minimum area contained by the set of features—since Metros don’t extend across all Urban Zones, our output polygons will not, by default, cover the entire city.\nTo adjust for this, we use the “Buffer region” option, which increases the extent of the output layer.\nChoose a destination and name for your output layer. Click run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave a look at your output. You may want to rearrange your layers so you can see what’s going on.\n\n\nMany of the polygons in this new layer extend well outside the border of the city. We will use the Clip tool to create an adjusted set of Voronoi polygons that align with Rome’s borders.\n\n\nThe Clip tool is located in the same place as the Buffer tool:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick run and then have a look at your results.

    "text": "It’s the 21st century—why are we using a desktop GUI-based software program? A few reasons:\n\nA GIS like QGIS or ESRI’s ArcGIS Pro provides a soft introduction to spatial thinking, managing spatial data files, and visualizing/analyzing information. It’s a lot to take in in just a few days.\nThe GUI (graphical user interface) component of a traditional GIS allows you to explore the wide range of cartographic and analytical options available.\nA GIS is great for visualizing multiple layers of information at once…and catching potential problems early…\nOnce you are comfortable with one GIS package, those skills will translate easily to other environments. You’re not just learning a software; you’re learning a way of thinking.\nGIS has amazing functionality, all in one place.",

    "text": "This bonus practical provides some additional practice mapping and also illustrates how table joins work (and are awesome).\n\nStart a new project.\nFrom the “EU_Mapping_Example” data, add the NUTS2 regions.\n\n Save your project!\n\nHave a look at the attribute table by right clicking on the layer and selecting Open Attribute Table. You’ll notice that all we have here are region names and codes, but no additional contextual data.\nHowever, we do have Total Fertility Rate data for 2020 in an aspatial spreadsheet format (yay!). To look at this data in QGIS, we need to load the file into the project.\nOpen your Data Source Manager by clicking on the Data Source Manager icon . Navigate to the NUTS2 Total Fertility csv spreadsheet in the EU Mapping Example folder and click on it. Click Add and Close.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should see the table appear in your layer list, but of course nothing will happen on your map (why?).\nRight click on your Fertility table and have a look at the attributes. Everything looks good: we have Name, a code, and a TFR_2020 variable. Close the table.\nNow go to Properties&gt;Information and scroll down.\n We want to check that the variables have been imported in the correct format—most importantly, that TFR_2020 has been imported as a number (double or integer) and not text (text or string). Text variables cannot be mapped in the same way as numerical information. Close the Properties window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA common way of getting data into a GIS is to find information in a spreadsheet that can then be combined with the layer attribute table. This is referred to as “joining tables” in a GIS and requires a common column—or primary key–of information in both tables that allows them to be merged into one bigger table that combines both contextual data and location information for each observation.\nThis primary key must uniquely identify each observation. Names of areas, such as “Haute-Normandie”, are one option but if Haute-Normandie is referred to as “Haute-Normandie” in one data source and “Haute Normandie” in the other, the GIS won’t know to match them. For this reason, we generally rely on unique identifier codes.\nLet’s join our Fertility data to the NUTS2 layer. To do this, have a look at both attribute tables and identify which variable both tables have in common.\n Note: the variable names do not have to be the same! However, their format (e.g., text) and contents do have to be the same. Here, GEO_codes and NUTS_ID contain the same information.\nRight click on the NUTS2 Layer, go to Properties and then choose Joins . Click on the  the bottom of the interface and a new window will open. Here is where you specify which table to join to the layer attribute table and which codes to use. Click OK and then Apply and OK in the Join window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see if the join worked, open the layer attribute table and scroll to the end. You should see the TFR_2020 variable from the csv table appended at the end. (you can also go directly to Symbology and map the TFR variable)\n Important note: No new data have been created! If you are happy with the join, right click on the layer and choose Export&gt;Save Features As… and save a new layer in your GeoPackage called NUTS2_TFR_2020. The new layer should be automatically added to your project.\n\n\nNow we are ready to classify and symbolise the data and then make a map!",

You may still have this layer (“AirBnb_entire_home”)—feel free to open it and use it; otherwise, re-create using steps in the first Tutorial.\nUsing the “AirBnb_entire_home” layer, we want to select AirBnbs that cost 5000 or more per night (there should be 56) and then create a new layer (Export&gt;Save Selected Features), called AirBnb_5000_or_more_entire_home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbolisation of AirBnbs: In your new layer, open Properties and go to Symbology. To visualise a continuous variable such as price, we need to select “Graduated” from the symbology options at the top. For Value, scroll down to the “price” variable.\nNow, for symbolisation, we have a choice between color and symbol size. In fact, there are many choices, including symbol choice, number of classes, and classification scheme. Work through your choices and then click Classify at the bottom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow spend some time choosing symbology for your Waterways and Neighbourhoods background colours (fill and border). You’re looking for an appealing combination of colours and symbology that still foregrounds the AirBnb data.\nLayout: Create a new print layout  and insert a new map window  to take up about half your page in landscape view (see below). Scale of around 450,000 is about right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Save!\n\nNow use the options on the left of the Layout window to add a Legend, North arrow, and scale bar. Note that each of these items has its own Properties, which can be viewed on the right of your screen. These include fonts, font size, and many other choices. Take your time exploring.\n Hint: Legends can be edited by turning off “Auto Update” and then deleting unused layers and changing variable names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is half of the map layout. When we go back to the main window, however, any changes we make to layers will automatically refresh in this map window.\nTo avoid this, under the Map’s main properties and Layer, click “Lock Layers” and “Lock Styles for Layers”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow go back to the main QGIS window, turn off the AirBnb layer, and turn on Cultural Locations.\nAlmost there! Symbolise your Cultural Locations layer, keeping in mind you want your choices to match well with the AirBnb map.\nCreate a second map in your layout that shows Cultural Locations and Neighbourhoods.\nFinalise and export your map layout. Your final map should include:\n\n\nTitle\nYour name\nLegends, scale bars, and North arrows for both maps\nSensible names for variables in your legend\nMap windows aligned and of the same size\n\n Hint: these tools in layout view assist with alignment, etc. \n\nBoth maps at the same scale",
