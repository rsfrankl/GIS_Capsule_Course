Navigate to your GIS_course folder (see image below).\n Right click on the directory link and add to Favorites. This will make it easier to find your data and projects this week!\nExpand the Rome_Data folder. You should see a cylinder icon and Rome_Data.gpkg. The “gpkg” file suffix indicates a geopackage, a collection of data readable to the GIS. The Rome_Data geopackage contains six layers.\nLet’s see what these data look like! The easiest way to add data in QGIS is to drag and drop—pull the layer down to the Layers panel and watch it appear.\n\n\n\n\nQGIS interface overview\n\n\n\n\nLayer visibility\n\nAdd the Airbnb and Cultural Locations layers from the Rome_Data geopackage and note how layers stack up in the Layers window.\nNote how QGIS draws from the bottom layer up (see below). To re-order layers, drag and drop them above and below each other—see how visibility changes?\nLayers can be turned off by unchecking the box next to the layer name. The layer will remain in the project but won’t be visible.\n\n\n\n\nQGIS layers\n\n\n\n\nLayer symbology\n\nLayer appearances can be changed. This includes fill colors, line thicknesses, and symbol choices, depending on feature type.\nTo change feature symbology, double click on a layer&gt;Symbology or right click&gt;Properties&gt;Symbology.\nClicking on  (for polygons) will open a range of options for color and outline (“stroke”) width and color.\n\n Your turn: Adjust the symbology and ordering of the three layers.",
